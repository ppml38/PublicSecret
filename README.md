# PublicSecret
Proof of concept, to store secrets in public.

## What is it?
People use secure password managers or rely on some softwares backed by encryption, to store data securely.
All these softwares will need persistence to store the data, and that is vulnerable to physical attacks like theft of hard disk etc.
If we store them on cloud, that will incur cost which is not profitable in long term.

So, the proposed idea is to store them on public discussion forums and social media, in a way that is recognizable only to you.
They are free and they have reliable storages.

Example: 
1.Storing your gmail password in your tweet.
2.Communicate a secrete message to your friend via a reddit comment in a top r/all post.

## How it works ?
To store your secret, open the app and enter it.
This app will then spit out bunch of ppunctuation marks derived from your secret.
You then create post/comment/blog that contains this punctuation in order.
Post it in your favourite social media.
Thats it.

When you need it back.
Copy that post from internet and paste back in the app, it will derive your secret from the text, and show it to you.
